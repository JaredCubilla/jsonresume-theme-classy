We will be experimenting with a migration.js system, each change below will be represented with a function that can update an older version of resume.json to the newer versions.\n\n### Major Versions\n\nThere will be a learning curve for the next few months as to how the ecosystem will revolve around versions. \n\nTo keep things simply, *JSON Resume tools are only expected react to major version changes*, therefore only when we hit version `1.0.0` should everything follow suit. The process for patches and fixes will be much more informal. Though we will try make everything work for the major versions.\n\n* [0.0.0 - First official version](https://github.com/jsonresume/resume-schema/blob/0.0.0/schema.json)\n\n### Change Log\n\n* 2014-07-30 - `languages` was added - [Dicussions](https://github.com/jsonresume/resume-schema/issues/34) - [Commit](https://github.com/jsonresume/resume-schema/commit/f02300e36ba076787d008928b29963c3ffce6121)\n* 2014-07-30 - `hobbies` renamed to `interests`\n* 2014-07-30 - `volunteer` was added  - [Discussion](https://github.com/jsonresume/resume-schema/issues/43) - [Commit](https://github.com/jsonresume/resume-schema/commit/dee007c2e373645b6b67d07a92aebf22fda5b95a)\n* 2014-07-30 - `summary` was added to `awards` - [Discussion](https://github.com/jsonresume/resume-schema/issues/119) - [Commit](https://github.com/jsonresume/resume-schema/commit/db5e7bcfa3f373d1293d6af073753ee41e3c3ba9)\n* 2014-07-30 - `summary` was added to `publications` - [Discussion](https://github.com/jsonresume/resume-schema/issues/126) - [Commit](https://github.com/jsonresume/resume-schema/pull/129)\n* 2014-07-22 - `bio` has been renamed to `basics` - [Discussion](https://github.com/jsonresume/resume-schema/issues/68) - [Commit](https://github.com/jsonresume/resume-schema/pull/117)\n* 2014-07-22 - `profiles` is now type array instead of object - [Discussion](https://github.com/jsonresume/resume-schema/issues/6) - [Commit](https://github.com/jsonresume/resume-schema/issues/6)\n* 2014-07-15 - `address` and `postalCode` added to `location` - [Discussion](https://github.com/jsonresume/resume-schema/issues/76) - [Commit](https://github.com/jsonresume/resume-schema/pull/110)\n* 2014-07-15 - `awardDate` changed to `date` - [Discussion](https://github.com/jsonresume/resume-schema/pull/107) - [Commit](https://github.com/jsonresume/resume-schema/pull/107)\n* 2014-07-13 - `websites` changed to `website`, changed from object into string - [Discussion](https://github.com/jsonresume/resume-schema/issues/10) - [Commit](https://github.com/jsonresume/resume-schema/pull/101)\n* 2014-07-13 - specified that `countryCode` should conform to ISO standard - [Discussion](https://github.com/jsonresume/resume-schema/pull/78) - [Commit](https://github.com/jsonresume/resume-schema/pull/78)\n* 2014-07-13 - `region` will replace `state` as the default - [Discussion](https://github.com/jsonresume/resume-schema/issues/19) - [Commit](https://github.com/jsonresume/resume-schema/pull/99)\n* 2014-07-12 - `picture` was added to the `bio` object - [Discussion](https://github.com/jsonresume/resume-schema/issues/29) - [Commit](https://github.com/jsonresume/resume-schema/pull/80)\n* 2014-07-12 - `gpa` was added to `education` objects - [Discussion](https://github.com/jsonresume/resume-schema/issues/7) - [Commit](https://github.com/jsonresume/resume-schema/pull/97)\n* 2014-07-12 - `email` and `phone` were changed from objects into strings - [Discussion](https://github.com/jsonresume/resume-schema/issues/27) - [Commit](https://github.com/jsonresume/resume-schema/pull/98)\n* 2014-07-12 - `firstName` and `lastName` were merged into `name` - [Discussion](https://github.com/jsonresume/resume-schema/issues/4) - [Commit](https://github.com/jsonresume/resume-schema/commit/717b2a525f4f42e9994c54bfa3cdbe0cea5776a6)\n\n### IRC\n\nEveryone working on the early stages of the project should join our Freenode channel\n\n```\n#jsonresume on freenode\n```\n\nYou can use the web client [http://webchat.freenode.net/](http://webchat.freenode.net/)\n\n### Getting Started\n\n```\nnpm install --save resume-schema\n```\n\nTo use\n\n```\nvar resumeSchema  = require('resume-schema');\nresumeSchema.validate({name: \"Thomas\"});\n```\n\nMore likely\n\n```\nvar fs = require('fs');\nvar resumeSchema  = require('resume-schema');\nvar resumeObject = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync('resume.json', 'utf8'));\nresumeSchema.validate(resumeObject);\n```\n\n### People\n\n* Julian Shapiro for early prototype revisions\n\n### Contribute\n\nWe encourage anyone who's interested in participating in the formation of this standard, to join us on IRC, and/or to join the discussions [here on GitHub](https://github.com/jsonresume/resume-schema/issues). Also feel free to fork this project and submit new ideas that you feel are a needed addition to the jsonresume standard. To make sure all formatting is kept in check, please install the [EditorConfig plugin](http://editorconfig.org/) for your editor of choice.\n\n### Versioning\n\nJSON Resume Schema adheres to Semantic Versioning 2.0.0. If there is a violation of\nthis scheme, report it as a bug. Specifically, if a patch or minor version is\nreleased and breaks backward compatibility, that version should be immediately\nyanked and/or a new version should be immediately released that restores\ncompatibility. Any change that breaks the public API will only be introduced at\na major-version release. As a result of this policy, you can (and should)\nspecify any dependency on JSON Resume Schema by using the Pessimistic Version\nConstraint with two digits of precision.\n\n### Research\n\n- [A more professional recruitment process with structured data](/research/A%20more%20professional%20recruitment%20process%20with%20structured%20CV%20data.pdf).\n\n### Proposals to reinvestigate\n\n* [#69 - Standard format for phone numbers](https://github.com/jsonresume/resume-schema/issues/69)\n* [#44 - Person-Job Fit ](https://github.com/jsonresume/resume-schema/issues/44)\n* [#12 - geotag location in work ](https://github.com/jsonresume/resume-schema/issues/12)\n* [#51 - Support multiple positions within one job](https://github.com/jsonresume/resume-schema/issues/51)\n\n### Other Resume Standards\n* [HR-XML](https://hr-xml.site-ym.com/store/default.aspx?)\n* [Europass](http://europass.cedefop.europa.eu/en/about)\n",
